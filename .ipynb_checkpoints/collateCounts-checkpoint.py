"""
This script reads word counts from STDIN and combines
the counts for any duplicated words.

INPUT & OUTPUT FORMAT:
    word \t count
USAGE:
    python collateCounts.py < yourCountsFile.txt

Instructions:
    For Q6 - Use the provided code as is. (you'll need to uncomment it)
    For Q7 - Delete or comment out the section marked "PROVIDED CODE" &
             replace it with your own implementation. Your solution 
             should not use a dictionary or store counts in any way - 
             just print them as soon as you've added them. HINT: you've
             modified the framework script to ensure that the input
             is alphabetized; how can you use that to your advantage?
